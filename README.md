For my license I decided to choose the GNU General Public License v3.0

The GNU license uses a a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. Copyleft is used when the developer wants to copyright the program and release it under an agreement that allows other people to use, modify or distribute it, or any program developed from it, but only if they apply the same agreement to the new work. I also found it interesting that it was founded by an organization who firmly believed in the idea of free software and advocated it to others so that they can create code freely without being threatened.
